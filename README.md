# Usage

```
 - Open the config.py file and if you don't have Minecraft in maximum window, GUI scale 2, and a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 and adjust the coordinates to yours
 - With the coordinates already adjusted, execute the DisEnchant.py script.
 ```bash
 py DisEnchant.py
 ```
 - You will have 3 seconds to switch to the Minecraft window and let it start disenchanting the items
